# Kent County, Michigan - 2020 Voting Data

This data was taken directly from [ElectionReporting.com](https://electionreporting.com/), and consists of the straight-party and individual presidential votes from Kent County, MI, in November 2020. This county was chosen because it appears in both of the videos below.

The same or similar data was used by Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai in his video titled "[Analysis of Michigan Votes Reveals Unfortunate Truth of U.S. Voting Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztu5Y5obWPk&ab_channel=Dr.ShivaAyyadurai)", as well as by Matt Parker (of the Youtube channel Stand-up Maths) in his video titled "[Do these scatter plots reveal fraudulent vote-switching in Michigan?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aokNwKx7gM8&ab_channel=Stand-upMaths)"

(Let me know if you'd like to see data from more counties added!)
