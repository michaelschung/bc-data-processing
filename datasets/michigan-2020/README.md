# Michigan 2020 Voting Data

This data was taken directly from [ElectionReporting.com](https://electionreporting.com/), and consists of the straight-party and individual presidential vote counts from 16 different Michigan counties in the November 2020 election.

<!-- Kent County, which is included in this data set, was used by Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai in his video titled "[Analysis of Michigan Votes Reveals Unfortunate Truth of U.S. Voting Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztu5Y5obWPk&ab_channel=Dr.ShivaAyyadurai)", as well as by Matt Parker (of the Youtube channel Stand-up Maths) in his video titled "[Do these scatter plots reveal fraudulent vote-switching in Michigan?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aokNwKx7gM8&ab_channel=Stand-upMaths)" -->

(Let me know if you'd like to see data from more counties added!)
