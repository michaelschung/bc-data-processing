# Notes on these data sets

I turned your data into a CSV file, but I had to slightly edit the column names. Your original table had super-columns for each round, but CSV files don't allow that. I got around this by changing the name of each column to begin with `R#` to specify which round it belongs to. I've included the original column headers in a tiny separate file called `original-column-headers.csv`.
