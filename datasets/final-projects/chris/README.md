# Notes on these data sets

I pulled all of the data sets from what you provided in the brainstorming document under Question 1.

The "Very large data set" from econweb.umd.edu had three different tables attached to it, so I pulled those into individual CSV files and put them in their own folder called `fiscal-data`. The name of each CSV file is the name of its tab from the original Excel file. Additionally, if you take a look at the `data` table in the original Excel file, you'll notice that the last four columns are grouped together with a kind of super-column called `Country Classification`. CSV files can't do that, so I approximated the same thing by adding the prefix `class-` to each of those columns.

The ranked choice voting data (from rankedchoicevoting.org and wikipedia.org) came in a lot of different tables, so I organized those by website. I think it should be pretty straightforward, but let me know if you have any questions!
