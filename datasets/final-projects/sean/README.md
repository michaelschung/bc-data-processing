# Notes on these data sets

Unfortunately, the link you provided for exploring opening moves on 365chess.com could not be scraped into CSV files. Instead, I did my best to find an extensive data set that might possibly work. I found [this one](https://www.kaggle.com/penchalaiah123/chess-game-dataset) on Kaggle. It's not data from professional players, but I hope it can help you do some good analysis anyway!
