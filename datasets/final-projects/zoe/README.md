# Notes on these data sets

- `book_data.csv`: From [here](https://www.kaggle.com/meetnaren/goodreads-best-books). This one is taken from the Goodreads "Best Books Ever" list, which has been widely criticized. But it does have information on genres.
- `goodreads_books_reduced.csv`: From [here](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/goodreads-books). This is, in my opinion, the best data set out of the three, as it has information such as dates and genres for pretty much every book. The only downside is that it's also taken from the "Best Books Ever" list. But I took the giant file from the website and cleaned it a bit, getting rid of the unnecessary columns such as `link`, `x_star_ratings`, and `amazon_redirect_link`.
- `books.csv`: From [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks). This one is nice since it's not from the "Best Books Ever" list, but it doesn't have information on genre, which is very unfortunate.
