    "_The primary objective of this assignment is for you to learn the power of GroupBy objects. I recommend that for each problem, you stop at intermediate points during the solving process to simply print out what you have up to that point._\n",
    "\n",
    "_For example, in #1 below, start by grouping the data by company; then, before moving on, check out your GroupBy object by printing out one or more of the groups._\n",
    "\n",
    "_Next, move on to finding the size of each group – this is easier than you may think it is! The whole point of a GroupBy object is to make it easier to operate on multiple \"sub-DataFrames\" at a time. If you can figure out how to find the size of a single DataFrame, you can pretty much expect it to work the same for a group of sub-DataFrames. Most functions that work for DataFrames simply get broadcast on a group-by-group basis when you apply them to a GroupBy object. If you're not sure whether your applied function worked or not, print your results and manually run them by your intuitions and expectations._\n",
    "\n",
    "_Moving on in the problem, you'll have to look up how to sort groups in descending order – this part should be more straightforward than the previous steps. After that, all you need to do is display the first ten rows!_"
