    "1. Head back to the [data sets page](https://github.com/michaelschung/bc-data-processing/tree/master/datasets), and pick one data set that you find particularly interesting.\n",
    "2. Download the file and use Pandas to load that data set. Before moving on, make sure that it downloaded as a `.csv` file! Check the assignment posting on Classroom if you're having issues.\n",
    "3. Explore the data by querying the DataFrame. Use this document to record your explorations according to the specifications below.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: There are tons of free data sets out there for you to explore, and in the future you'll be able to use any that you like. For this assignment, however, pick one of the data sets that I've provided for you._\n",

    "- 2-3 sentences (in English) that use the query results to answer the initial question\n",
