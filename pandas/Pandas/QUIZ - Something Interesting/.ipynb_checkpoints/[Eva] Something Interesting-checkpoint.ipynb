    "3. Explore the data by querying the DataFrame. Use this document to record your explorations according to the specifications below.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: There are tons of free data sets out there for you to explore, and in the future you'll be able to use any that you like. For this assignment, however, pick one of the data sets that I've provided for you._\n",

    "- A concrete question (in English) that you're trying to answer\n",

    "- 2-3 sentences (in English) that use the query results to answer the initial question\n",
